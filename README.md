# feathers_socket_client

Simple client for feathers using sockets

## Getting Started

At the moment there is only the client for the connection and to handle the basic crisis, we hope to increase the functionalities in addition to improving the documentation and the structure of the project. You are welcome to contribute with the structure or code of the library to improve it. Then an TODO will go up to organize the main elements to improve the library.
